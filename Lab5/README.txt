Lab 5: Functions and Graphics


DESCRIPTION:

In this lab, we implement functions that perform primitive graphic operations on a simulated display. 


FILES:

Lab5.asm - This file includes the assembly code of the lab


INSTRUCTIONS:

This program is intended to run with MIPS Assembler in MARS. User can use functions in Lab5.asm to "draw" and the output drawing can be viewed in the MARS Bitmap Display. There are functions to draw pixel by pixel, horizontal lines, vertical lines, and cross hairs using their coordinate locations in format 0x00XX00YY.
