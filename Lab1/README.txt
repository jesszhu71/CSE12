Lab 1: Intro to Logic Simulation


DESCRIPTION:

In this lab, we used Multimedia Logic (MML) to practice designing circuits from truth tables under varying conditions. 


FILES:

Lab1.lgi - This file includes all three parts of the lab assignment, circuit simulations designed to complete each part of the lab. 


INSTRUCTIONS:

This program is intended to run with Multimedia Logic (MML). The first page contains 4 switches and the output of all three parts of the assignment. To run the circuits, click on "Run Simulation" and switch the 4 input switches to see different outputs.
